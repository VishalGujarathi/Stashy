    <p>Stashy is a library trying to help with responsive designs. Inside, you can find layouts and utilities perhaps could be useful for you.</p>
    <p>Components in this library are mainly focused in layouts, so you have to style them  properly on your own for look and feel like you are looking for. For example, this site is using the awesome <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> plus some personal css. </p>
    <p>All pages in this site were built using Stashy, so you can check what can you do with this components going around the docs. </p>
